            <p>I have always felt a bit uncomfortable that Docker has no manner of running without dockerd, a daemon which must be ran as root to manage the networking of any running containers. I have known for quite some time that an unprivileged user in the docker group can utilize dockerd to escalate to a root shell, feel free to try the command below.</p>

            <figure class="highlight">
              <code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">
              $ docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
              </code>
            </figure>

            <p>While researching this problem I'd stumbled upon Podman, a drop in replacement with 1:1 compatibility with all the docker tools I'd used up to that point and also ran in an unprivileged environment. Podman quelled my concerns for a time but not completely. I would often consider potential exploits a compromised container could utilize to scan for vunerable devices on my <abbr title='Local Area Network'>LAN</abbr>, fetch local ssh keys, or even gather intel on the host device itself. It can be argued, and rightfully so, that an intruder would first have to exploit a zero day vunerablility in docker itself or one of the dependencies it relies on but even so I wasn't willing to take the chance on a production machine with access to my home network. My search for a more complete solution began and after quite a bit of careful consideration, I decided to settle with QEMU.</p>

            <h2>But wait, doesn't QEMU also require libvirtd to run as root?</h2>

            <p>A valid mistake, and after having used virt-manager for many years I was under the same impression before coming to the realization that QEMU can be run independently when set to use user networking. Before beginning ensure your user is in the kvm group, although this isn't required its highly recommended for setups where multiple containers will be used. To begin you will have to install QEMU and KVM on your host device, below is an example on gentoo. After having finished the install you will need to attach an iso and ssh into the device to complete the install. Since user networked devices do not have an accessible ip address, at least to my knowledge, I've opted to forward port 22 on the virtual machine to 22222 on localhost using hostfwd=tcp::22222-:22. From there the rest of the install is pretty standard, just ensure your install iso has sshd enabled as an init service. Alternatively you can always use vnc or format your disk image inside virt manager and copy the disk over once you've finished your setup.</p>

            <figure class="highlight">
              <code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">
                $ emerge qemu kvm<br />
                $ usermod -aG kvm USERNAME<br />
                <br />
                # The zero below signifies a dynamically allocated disk. Alternatively you can set a fixed limit for instance 20G.<br />
                $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 image.qcow2 0<br />
                <br />
                $ qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -smp 2 \<br />
                -cdrom distro.iso -boot d \<br />
                -hda image.qcow2 \<br />
                -netdev user,id=mynet.0,net=10.0.10.0/24,hostfwd=tcp::22222-:22 \<br />
                -device rtl8139,netdev=mynet.0 \<br />
                -enable-kvm<br />
                <br />
                $ ssh root@localhost -p 22222<br />
                <br />
                # Begin the standard installation procedure for your system...
              </code>
            </figure>

            <p>Once the installation procedure is complete all thats left now is to ssh into your machine and set up your service. Make sure to utilize hostfwd to forward any ports you plan on accessing via the host machine. An alternative approach to forward the ports using ssh.</p>

            <figure class="highlight">
              <code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">
              # Assuming the service you are trying to access is available at port 8080 on the target machine.<br />
              $ qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -smp 2 \<br />
              -hda image.qcow2 \<br />
              -netdev user,id=mynet.0,net=10.0.10.0/24,hostfwd=tcp::22222-:22,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:8080 \<br />
              -device rtl8139,netdev=mynet.0 \<br />
              -enable-kvm<br />
              <br />
              $ ssh root@localhost -p 22222<br />
              <br />
              # You can now start/configure your service.
              </code>
            </figure>

            <p>Now after putting http://localhost:8080 into your url bar you should see your service or docker container on the host device. You can use the same process to pass ports from your host to the target.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Is running a docker container inside a virtual machine really any superior to running docker on the host machine itself? The question posed is a difficult one to answer and varies depending on your setup. After having read about malicious containers or a new docker <abbr title='Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures'>CVE</abbr> almost quarterly, I'd decided that running my services inside a sandboxed environment would better contain any potential exploits.</p>
