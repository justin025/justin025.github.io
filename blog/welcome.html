            <p>Over the years I have been using a text file to store all of my notes regarding the countless projects I've attempted or completed, and as of late it's become extremely unorganized. The purpose of this website is to properly archive some of the more obscure problems and solutions I've faced so that hopefully I can help others in the process.</p>

            <p>The services tab hosts links to various public and private services I am currently hosting. The reading tab is quite bare at the moment but will at one point serve as an organized list of recommendations. If you would like access any of my publically facing websites, have any requests/recommendations, or just would like to chat feel free to send me an email at the following address, <a href="mailto:justin026@protonmail.com">justin026@protonmail.com</a> | <a href="./assets/email.asc">PGP</a>.</p>
